				<div class="prototypeConcept">
					<p class="seize">
					Cosmo Squabble is a <span class="blue">2 versus 2 shooter</span> which lets the players embody alien pilots and their irreplaceable AI co-pilots in a comical spaceship battle. Their goal is to destroy the opponents' ship. </p>
					</br><p class="seize">The most important aspect of the game is the <span class="blue">cooperation dynamic</span> for each duo : The pilot controls the ship with his <span class="blue">pawn</span>, whereas the co-pilot triggers various attacks and effects with his <span class="blue">deck of connected cards</span>. 
					This complementarity implies communication and coordination, but also allows intergenerational play. Indeed, <span class="blue">people with different skills and gaming backgrounds can share the same experience</span> because each role demands different skills or attitudes from the player.</p>
					</br><p class="seize">As an example, our playtests showed that a parent with absolutely no gaming experience can play in cooperation with its more experienced child by leaving them the "attack and dodge" pilot role and playing the more strategic co-pilot position.</p>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="whatILearned">
					<p class="seize"> During my internship I mostly worked on this project : I <span class="blue">designed the whole experience</span> in order to make the most of the console's unique particularities, handled the <span class="blue">balancing</span> of the game and <span class="blue">supervised the playtesting process</span>.
