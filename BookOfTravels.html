				<div class="prototypeConcept">
					<p class="seize">Book of Travels is a <span class="blue">Tiny Multiplayer Online RPG</span> which centers the experience around meaningful encounters amongst players and discovering a beautiful, mysterious and deep world.
				</br> </br> I joined the production team during the last 6 months before the games <span class="blue">Early Access release</span> and worked with four other programmers to reach the quality needed for the release. 
				Working in a team of around 20 people was an new experience that allowed me to interact with lots of different disciplines, find my place and <span class="blue">take ownership</span> of the responsibilities that were assigned to me.
				I also learned a lot of core principles for programming online games and how to approach building/debugging networked game mechanics efficiently.

				<div class="whatILearned">
					<p class="seize">As I was joining a project that has been in development for 5 years I worked to <span class="blue">adapt quickly in order to get familiar with the code base</span> and this allowed me to take my first responsibilities on some of the games features.
					</br></br></p>
					<p class="seize"><span class="bold">Creatures and Props :</span> Our team was subdivided in focus groups for different features of the game and I was the <span class="blue">referent programmer for the "Creatures and Props" group</span>. 
					</br> My work included <span class="blue">discussing technical solutions</span> with designers, animators and tech artists in order to solve issues efficiently, as well as implementing those solutions in order to <span class="blue">facilitate content integration</span>.
					I also handled integration for animations in Unity and fixed all bugs and issues related to NPCs and props.
					</br></br></p>
					<p class="seize"><span class="bold">Other work :</span> During my time on the project I got to work on a range of different tasks in order to <span class="blue">support the team</span> wherever it was needed. This include maintaining and improving the weather manager and the character lighting system in collabortation with our tech artists,
						but also helping out on minor UI tasks and implementing additional gameplay or tool features following the game designers specifications. Of course a lot of my work went into fixing bugs and stabilizing the game for the Early Access release and following patching weeks.
