					<p class="seize">This boardgame was made as a 1st year school project 
					over <span class="blue">8 months</span>. We worked as a team of <span class="blue">2 game designers and 2 artists</span> in order to create a fully finished product.</p>
					</br>
					<p class="seize">Dark Sector's adventure takes place in a <span class="blue">science-fiction</span> world where humanity has expanded through space.
					<span class="blue">2 to 4 players cooperate</span> as an expedition team sent to a sector devastated by an unknown alien threat.
					Their mission is to learn more about this threat to prepare the "Ultralliance" for the oncoming invasion.</p>		
					</br>
					<p class="seize">The game focuses on :</p>
					<p class="point"><span class="blue">Exploration :</span> The Cards composing the different places as well as the Event Booklet allow each exploration to be unique.</p>
					<p class="point"><span class="blue">Survival :</span> Players are pressured by limited oxygen and dangerous encounters with aliens.</p>
					<p class="point"><span class="blue">Deduction :</span> A set of caracteristics for the alien threat is drawn at the begining of each game, with hints the player has to unlock.</p>
					
					<p class="wil" style="margin: 15px 0px 10px 0px;">My work</p>
					<p class="seize"> As a game designer on this project I designed the core rules and systems of the game, 
					those included the  <span class="blue">dice based combat system</span>, our  <span class="blue">exploration system</span> (how the levels are composed of cards and how players actually interact with it and our different events) and the  <span class="blue">investigation system</span> (unlocking clues and deducing the solution from the game's lore).
					<br />I also worked on the  <span class="blue">balancing</span> of the game and conducted part of our playtests.
