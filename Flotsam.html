				<div class="prototypeConcept">
					<p class="seize">I worked on Flotsam during my 4 month internship at <a href="http://www.pajamallama.be/" target="_blank">Pajama Llama</a> and
					I had the chance to be there for the game's Early Access release which took place on the last day of my internship.</p>
					<p class="seize">During my internship I worked on new as well as already existing <span class="blue">gameplay features, UI programming and bug-fixing</span> during the period preceding the Early Access release. 
					We also <span class="blue">worked in English</span> during the whole duration of the internship.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="whatILearned">
					<p class="seize">First of all this internship was a very valuable experience. I got to work in  <span class="blue">autonomy</span> on new features as well as a lot of existing ones : 
					I reworked them from the closed-alpha player feedback to match the quality requirements of the Early-Access release. 
					The diversity of the tasks allowed me to <span class="blue">quickly become familiar with the game's code base</span>. </p>
					
					<p class="seize"></br><span class="bold">Alternative navigation mode for agents :</span> Flotsam agents' navigation is handled thanks to an A* pathfinding algorithm but we needed them to alternatively be able to use Unity's NavMesh navigation for specific cases.
					I <span class="blue">refactored the navigation code with inspiration from the Strategy design pattern</span> in order to decouple as much as possible the navigation-related calls and the used strategy. </p>
					
					<p class="seize"></br><span class="bold">Survival Guide :</span> I created the UI architecture of an in-game guide for the player. 
					The guide <span class="blue">allows the rest of the team to easily and efficiently add pages and categories</span> without having to code thanks to Scriptable Objects.
					I also implemented a <span class="blue">notification system</span> in order to highlight pages for the player's attention when they perform specific game actions.</p>
					
					<p class="seize"></br><span class="bold">Save Menu :</span> The saving system needed to be extended to handle multiple save files instead of only one. Therefore I created the <span class="blue">UI</span> of the saving slots and implemented the <span class="blue">management of the save files</span>. </p>
				
					<p class="seize"></br><span class="bold">Bug-fixing :</span> I focused my efforts on bug fixing  during the three last weeks in order to help us get the game ready for the <span class="blue">Early-Access release</span>.</p>
