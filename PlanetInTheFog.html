				<div class="prototypeConcept">
					<p class="seize"> A Planet in the Fog is a <span class="blue">first person exploration</span> game centered on <span class="blue">navigating a treacherous environment</span> and understanding the ecosystem of a planet covered in fog. 
					</br> This was my graduation project and we worked in a team of 9 people. 
					I worked on prototyping the controller at first, then another programmer joined the project and took over controller related features, my responsibilities were to work on  <span class="blue">UI and systems</span>.
				Secondarily my role in the team was to handle technical setup, documentation and support for source control or engine related issues.</p>

				<div class="whatILearned">
					<p class="seize"><span class="bold">Pheromone system :</span> The ecosystem of the game relies heavily on pheromones carried by winds around the planet, I opted for using a grid system since it operated on a large scale and didn't need that much precision.
					</br>Winds are represented by nodes being connected in a directional way and the grid handles the propagation and dissipation of each pheromone type along the winds. 
						I made it possible to <span class="blue">easily create different Pheromone Emitters and Pheromone Receivers</span> which respectively emits or detects a specific kind of pheromones.
					</br></br>As a result, I worked in <span class="blue">collaboration with our level designers to build a tool</span> that would allow them to easily visualize and create connections between the nodes to get the desired winds on the map. 
					</p><br><br>
					<p class="seize"><span class="bold">Map and UI :</span> One of the player's main tool is a map that allows them to <span class="blue">visualise data they gather on the area in real time</span>. 
						Placing probes on the environment allows the player to visualise on the map the pheromones present in a radius around the probe, and the map also features <span class="blue">filters</span> to select which information to show like the winds or a specific type of pheromones.
						I built the whole feature and handled it's <span class="blue">interaction with the pheromone system</span>.
					</br></br>
					The player also gathers information by scanning specimens and unlocking entries in a databes, I took care of <span class="blue">building the UI and data management</span> for that feature.
						</p><br>
					<!--<p class="seize"><span class="bold">AIs :</span> Goal Oriented Action Planning seems to be the most suitable technic to manage individual agents interacting in our ecosystem.
					I am currently working on adapting a GOAP framework to our needs : first by making the functionnalities of the framework accessible for our game designers in the engine's editor, 
					and secondly to make it compatible with our pheromone diffusion system.
